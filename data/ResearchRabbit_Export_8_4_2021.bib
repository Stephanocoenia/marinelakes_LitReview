Yet, in contrast to terrestrial species, marine species have attracted little attention in studies of island theory. The experimental and conceptual origins of this dichotomy date back to the 1970s, although the apposition has softened in the early 2000s, in part a consequence of phylogeographic analyses and the discovery of new marine environments. Here, I explore the possible range of island and island-like settings in the marine realm and find good evidence, albeit in short supply, for integrating marine with terrestrial perspectives during the current transition from equilibrium to general dynamic models of island biogeography. This integration of marine systems into island theory will be facilitated by three advances: (1) development of many descriptive marine studies to reduce the current deficit, (2) design of rigorous comparative studies within and across realms, and (3) modification of conceptual models to unite seemingly disparate situations, for example describing islands in terms of ecological–evolutionary processes. Marine island biogeography is in its infancy; it may present situations that are uncommon in the existing literature, but not rare in nature, and thus contribute substantially to the new dynamic outlook on a half-century-old theme.}}

Marine lakes are posited to be marine islands, however, unlike terrestrial islands for which rich models have been developed over the past half-century, we know little of the mechanisms driving changes in marine lakes. This is a critical knowledge gap in efforts to reconcile theory on, or distinguish differences among, island and island-like systems. To reduce this critical knowledge gap, we present a mathematical model describing marine lakes based on a case study of Jellyfish Lake (Ongeim’l Tketau, Mecherchar: OTM), Palau. Empirical data show that marine lakes exhibit delayed and reduced tidal motions, suggesting exchange of a limited amount of water with the neighboring (‘mainland’) ocean. Our model tracks changes in lake level, allowing determination of an exchange rate that is a physical null model for biological colonization and a proxy for colonization distance in island biogeography theory. In addition, we track horizontally averaged in-lake quantities such as salinity and temperature (i.e., marine weather, climate) and stratification (i.e., habitat) — that are known to influence resident species’ distributions and population dynamics — by solving an advection-diffusion equation. We find that weather, ocean conditions, groundwater, and exchanges through tunnels determine the abiotic environment in OTM. By comparing simulations and data, we estimate the difficult-to-measure properties of the surrounding groundwater — the ‘matrix’ in the vernacular of habitat islands — and give a range of realistic values for the effective diffusion coefficient. This coefficient is found to increase in a tropical storm, suggesting that other drivers can be important during perturbations.}}

Based on parameters such as bathymetry, size, coastline, salinity, water temperature, pH, degree of connection to the sea, and the presence-absence of selected key taxa we distinguish three types of (non-cave) anchialine systems in the Indo-Pacific: (1) Marine lakes with large and deep basins containing brackish to almost fully marine waters. Marine lakes show a range in the degree of connection to the sea with the result that the higher the connection the more the lake resembles a lagoon in both water chemistry and biota, while the more isolated lakes have brackish water and contain unique species that are rarely found in the adjacent sea. (2) Anchialine pools with small and shallow basins containing brackish water and low diversity of macrofauna. (3) Blue pools in chasms that contain water with a clear halocline and are possibly connected to anchialine caves. Study of the many unique features of anchialine systems will enhance our understanding of the physical and ecological processes responsible for diversification in tropical shallow marine environments.}}

In the present study, we used a 16S rRNA gene barcoded pyrosequencing approach and a predictive metagenomic approach (PICRUSt) to examine bacterial composition and function in three distinct biotopes (sediment, water and the sponge species Biemna fortis) in three habitats (two marine lakes and the open sea) of the Berau reef system, Indonesia. Both biotope and habitat were significant predictors of higher taxon abundance and compositional variation. Most of the variation in operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition was related to the biotope (42% for biotope alone versus 9% for habitat alone and 15% combined). Most OTUs were also restricted to a single biotope (1047 for B. fortis, 6120 for sediment and 471 for water). Only 98 OTUs were shared across all three biotopes. Bacterial communities from B. fortis, sediment and water samples were, however, also distinct in marine lake and open sea habitats. This was evident in the abundance of higher bacterial taxa. For example, the phylum Cyanobacteria was significantly more abundant in samples from marine lakes than from the open sea. This difference was most pronounced in the sponge B. fortis. In line with the compositional differences, there were pronounced differences in predicted relative gene count abundance among biotopes and habitats. Of particular interest was the predicted enrichment in B. fortis from the marine lakes for pathways including DNA replication and repair and the glutathione metabolism. This may facilitate adaptation of host and microbes to life in ‘stressful’ low pH, low salinity and/or high temperature environments such as those encountered in marine lakes.}}

Here we provide baseline data on planktonic communities of Archaea, Bacteria and microeukaryotes inside and outside (open water habitat) of three marine lakes (Kakaban, Haji Buang and Tanah Bamban) in the Berau region of Indonesia. Compositional variation was highly congruent with the major axis of variation separating open water from marine lake samples for all three domains. Planktonic Archaea mainly consisted of OTUs assigned to Euryarchaeota that were closely related to organisms in Genbank previously obtained from seawater samples. The majority of archaeal OTUs were most abundant in open water habitat with a few OTUs abundant in all habitats. Most bacterial sequences were assigned to Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes with the percentage of Cyanobacteria highest in two of the marine lakes and lowest in the remaining lake (Tanah Bamban). In contrast to Archaea, there were a number of bacterial OTUs that were markedly more abundant in marine lake habitat. Most microeukaryote sequences were assigned to the Alveolata, Stramenopiles, Opisthokonta, Archaeplastida and Hacrobia. As was the case with Bacteria, a number of abundant microeukaryote OTUs were more abundant in marine lake habitat. Our results thus indicate similar compositional responses to the environmental conditions in marine lake habitat across the major domains of life and point to marine lakes harbouring distinct microbial communities.}}

We used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and predicted metagenomic analysis to compare microbial composition and function. Marine lakes are small landlocked bodies of seawater isolated to varying degrees from the open sea environment. They contain numerous endemic taxa and represent natural laboratories of speciation. Our primary goals were to (1) use BLAST search to identify closely related organisms to dominant bacterial OTUs in our mussel dataset and (2) to compare bacterial communities and enrichment in the predicted bacterial metagenome among lakes. Our sequencing effort yielded 3553 OTUs belonging to 44 phyla, 99 classes and 121 orders. Mussels in the largest marine lake (Kakaban) and the coastal mangrove habitat were dominated by bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria whereas smaller lakes, located on the island of Maratua, were dominated by bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes and Tenericutes. The single most abundant OTU overall was assigned to the genus Mycoplasma. There were several significant differences among locations with respect to metabolic pathways. These included enrichment of xenobiotic biodegradation pathways in the largest marine lake and coastal mangrove. These locations were also the most enriched with respect to nitrogen metabolism. The presence of genes related to isoquinoline alkaloids, polyketides, hydrolases, mono and dioxygenases in the predicted analysis of functional pathways is an indication that the bacterial communities of Brachidontes mussels may be potentially important sources of new marine medicines and enzymes of industrial interest. Future work should focus on measuring how mussel microbial communities influence nutrient dynamics within the marine lake environment and isolating microbes with potential biotechnological applications.}}

In the present study, we used a 16S rRNA gene barcoded pyrosequencing approach to examine prokaryote (Bacteria and Archaea) composition in three distinct biotopes (sediment, water and the mussel Brachidontes sp.) inhabiting four habitats, namely, three marine lakes and the surrounding marine environment of Berau, Indonesia.

Most bacterial sequences belonged to OTUs assigned to the Proteobacteria. Compared to sediment and water, mussels had relatively high abundances of the classes Mollicutes and Epsilonproteobacteria. Most archaeal sequences, in turn, belonged to OTUs assigned to the Crenarchaeota with the relative abundance of crenarchaeotes highest in mussel samples. For both Bacteria and Archaea, the main variation in composition was between water samples on the one hand and sediment and mussel samples on the other. Sediment and mussels also shared much more OTUs than either shared with water.

Only 13 species were shared among all habitats. The 2 marine lakes are located 10 km apart, but their assemblages were more similar to each other than to the bay mangrove systems just 200 to 500 m away. Our results show that marine lakes represent a distinct habitat with significantly higher sponge cover and abundance as well as a markedly different species composition when compared with coastal mangroves. In both lake and coastal mangrove habitats there was a pronounced gradient in composition away from the shore with the primary difference between solid (root or rock) and soft substrate (mud or sand). Each substrate type harbored different sets of species in both lake and coastal mangrove habitats. There was no significant difference in sponge species composition, abundance, or cover between semi-permanent transects sampled in 2008 and 2009. We show for the first time that mangroves in the Indo-Pacific harbor a diverse array of sponge species and, further, that marine lakes harbor numerous unique species hitherto unknown to science.}}

Sweetings Pond, an anchialine lake on the island of Eleuthera in The Bahamas was identified as a site of high Caribbean reef octopus, Octopus briareus ( Robson, 1929 ) density, relative to coastal populations. However, observed deterioration in local benthic habitat and increased anthropogenic influence over the last 30years imply that this octopus population may have undergone density and distribution shifts in response to these changing conditions. Here, we assess the system wide octopus density to provide an updated estimate. We hypothesize that despite depressed habitat availability in the 1980s, it will now support octopus densities less than historical estimates because of increasing human impact on the system. Drivers of abundance were also modelled, testing ecological hypotheses of the relationship between octopus count and prey, habitat coverage, and human disturbance. Octopus briareus were found in 7 of 27 of surveys with a mean survey count of 0.630±1.25 per 900 m2. Octopus density did not vary significantly between sites. Octopus count was predicted to increase with increasing cover of calcareous rubble and the density of a preferred prey species, and intriguingly, counts decreased as a function of natural den abundance. System wide octopus density was comparable to earlier studies from the 1980s (1982=717.38 per km2; 1983=282.59 per km2; 2019=643.81 per km2) with no significant difference between years. Given the ecosystem's unique and closed ecological community and the population dynamics and distribution drivers we present, Sweetings Pond has the potential to act as a ‘natural laboratory’ to explore further questions about marine insular systems and their influence on species populations in terms of ecological and behavioural change.}}

Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Synechococcophycidae and Flavobacteriia were the most abundant classes in water. Jellyfish-associated bacterial communities were dominated by OTUs assigned to the Gammaproteobacteria (family Endozoicimonaceae), Mollicutes, Spirochaetes and Alphaproteobacteria (orders Kiloniellales and Rhodobacterales). Mollicutes were mainly restricted to Mastigias whereas Spirochaetes and the order Kiloniellales were most abundant in Tripedalia hosts.

Other abundant OTUs included an OTU assigned to the order Entomoplasmatales and mainly found in Mastigias hosts and OTUs assigned to the Spirochaetes and order Kiloniellales and mainly found in Tripedalia hosts. The low sequence similarity of the Entomoplasmatales OTU to sequences in Genbank suggests that it may be a novel lineage inhabiting Mastigias and possibly restricted to marine lakes}}

Here we ask whether populations of the mussel Brachidontes from marine lakes in Berau, East Kalimantan (Indonesia) are isolated from each other and from the coastal mangrove systems. We analyzed sequence data of one mitochondrial marker (Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI)), and two nuclear markers (18S and 28S). In addition, we examined shell shape using a geometric morphometric approach. The Indonesian populations of Brachidontes spp. harbored four deeply diverged lineages (14–75% COI corrected net sequence divergence), two of which correspond to previously recorded lineages from marine lakes in Palau, 1,900 km away. These four lineages also showed significant differences in shell shape and constitute a species complex of at least four undescribed species. Each lake harbored a different lineage despite the fact that the lakes are separated from each other by only 2–6 km, while the two mangrove populations, at 20 km distance from each other, harbored the same lineage and shared haplotypes. Marine lakes thus represent isolated habitats. As each lake contained unique within lineage diversity (0.1–0.2%), we suggest that this may have resulted from in situdivergence due to isolation of founder populations after the formation of the lakes (6,000–12,000 years before present). Combined effects of stochastic processes, local adaptation and increased evolutionary rates could produce high levels of differentiation in small populations such as in marine lake environments. Such short-term isolation at small spatial scales may be an important contributing factor to the high marine biodiversity that is found in the Indo-Australian Archipelago.}}

Such observations suggest isolation at small scales may play an important role in forming patterns of genetic diversity within species. Isolation‐by‐distance, isolation‐by‐environment, and historical priority effects are umbrella terms for a suite of processes that underlie genetic structure, but their relative importance at different spatial and temporal scales remains elusive. Here, we use marine lakes in Indonesia to assess genetic structure and test relative roles of the processes in shaping genetic differentiation in populations of a bivalve mussel (Brachidontes sp.). Marine lakes are landlocked water bodies of similar age (6,000 – 10,000 years), but with heterogeneous environments and varying degrees of connection to the sea. Using a population genomic approach (double‐digest Restriction‐site Associated DNA sequencing), we show strong genetic structuring across populations (range FST: 0.07 – 0.24), and find limited gene flow through admixture plots. At large spatial scales (>1400km), a clear isolation‐by‐distance pattern was detected. At smaller spatial scales (<200km), this pattern is maintained, but accompanied by an association of genetic divergence with degree of connection. No signatures of isolation‐by‐environment were found. We hypothesize that (incomplete) dispersal barriers can cause initial isolation, allowing priority effects to give the numerical advantage necessary to initiate strong genetic structure. Priority effects may be strengthened by local adaptation, which our data potentially corroborates by showing a high correlation between mussel genotypes and temperature. Our study indicates an often‐neglected role of evolution‐mediated priority effects in shaping population divergence.}}

Marine lakes are landlocked water bodies that maintain a marine character through narrow submarine connections to the sea and could be regarded as the marine equivalents of terrestrial islands. The sponge Suberites diversicolor (Porifera: Demospongiae: Suberitidae) is typical of marine lake habitats in the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Four molecular markers (two mitochondrial and two nuclear) were employed to study genetic structure of populations within and between marine lakes in Indonesia and three coastal locations in Indonesia, Singapore and Australia. Within populations of S. diversicolor two strongly divergent lineages (A & B) (COI: p=0.4% and ITS: p=7.3%) were found, that may constitute cryptic species. Lineage A only occurred in Kakaban lake (East Kalimantan), while lineage B was present in all sampled populations. Within lineage B, we found low levels of genetic diversity in lakes, though there was spatial genetic population structuring. The Australian population is genetically differentiated from the Indonesian populations. Within Indonesia we did not record an East-West barrier, which has frequently been reported for other marine invertebrates. Kakaban lake is the largest and most isolated marine lake in Indonesia and contains the highest genetic diversity with genetic variants not observed elsewhere. Kakaban lake may be an area where multiple putative refugia populations have come into secondary contact, resulting in high levels of genetic diversity and a high number of endemic species.}}

Location: Marine lakes and coastal locations in Indonesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Taxon: Mussels (Mytilidae, Brachidontes spp.). Methods: Populations were sampled from four coastal locations and 22 marine lakes of similar age (~8,000 years), yet differing in size (0.04–4.7 km2) and degree of connection to the adjacent sea. While some lakes are highly connected, allowing potential influx of larvae from the sea, others have very limited water exchange. We assessed the phylogeographical structure and demographic history using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data, and combined this with geometric morphometrics. The effects of lake characteristics on population genetic diversity and structure were tested using linear regression and Mantel tests. Results: Each lake contained one of six distinct genetic lineages, which were characterized by deep phylogenetic splits and significant morphometric differences. These lineages likely represent separate species. The lineages showed similar demographic patterns, with lakes containing founder populations that rapidly expanded and diverged. Genetic diversity within lake populations was significantly correlated with lake area, but not with physical connection to the adjacent sea. Within lineages that occurred in multiple lakes there was strong population structure (average ΦST 0.65), which did not conform to an isolation-by-distance pattern or to the degree of dispersal potential. Main Conclusions: Marine lakes across a gradient of physical isolation show strong population structure and evidence for in situ divergence. We hypothesize that the observed genetic structure is the result of priority effects. In addition, reduction of habitat size appears to reduce genetic diversity, even at very small spatial scales. Our findings are relevant in the context of ongoing alterations to coastal hydrodynamics, which lead to habitat reduction and influence migration among populations at fine spatial scales.}}

These pools are situated at some distance from the sea, but, because the level of the water rises and falls with the tides, must have subterranean connections with the sea. The shrimps belong to species that so far have not been found outside this special type of habitat, although some have a rather extensive geographical distribution. Apart from the peculiar habitat in which they are found and apart from their red coloration, there is very little that these species have in common. The 11 species so far found exclusively in these pools belong to 9 different genera and to 5 different families (see also Holthuis, 1963; Chace & Manning, 1972). It is suggested now to use the term "anchialine" (from the Greek anchialos, near the sea) to indicate this type of habitat, rather than to have to define it each time as "pools with no surface connection with the sea, containing salt or brackish water, which fluctuates with the tides". Recently, I received unusually interesting caridean material taken from several of such anchialine pools in the Indo-West Pacific region. This material was provided by various persons.

Surface tidal exchange through fissures in fenestrated karst is slow while midwater exchange through submarine tunnels is fast, but both produce damped, delayed tides with modest seawater exchange from the barrier-reef lagoon. Topographic protection from wind, heavy regular rain throughout the year, with precipitation exceeding evaporation, and modest tidal exchange produce stratified water columns with brackish waters above permanently anoxic saline hypolimnia. Permanent lake stratification is documented for 18 years; sediment cores (by others) show stratification for >100 years, and recent constant sea level implies ecosystem stab...}}

These complications may be alleviated by studying systems with simpler histories and clearer boundaries, such as marine lakes—small bodies of seawater entirely surrounded by land. As an example, we consider the jellyfish Mastigias spp. which occurs in two ecotypes, one in marine lakes and one in coastal oceanic habitats, throughout the Indo-West Pacific (IWP). We tested three evolutionary hypotheses to explain the current distribution of the ecotypes: (H1) the ecotypes originated from an ancient divergence; (H2) the lake ecotype was derived recently from the ocean ecotype during a single divergence event; and (H3) the lake ecotype was derived from multiple, recent, independent, divergences. We collected specimens from 21 locations throughout the IWP, reconstructed multilocus phylogenetic and intraspecific relationships, and measured variation in up to 40 morphological characters. The species tree reveals three reciprocally monophyletic regional clades, two of which contain ocean and lake ecotypes, suggesting repeated, independent evolution of coastal ancestors into marine lake ecotypes, consistent with H3; hypothesis testing and an intraspecific haplotype network analysis of samples from Palau reaffirms this result.

However, their biological definition is complex. Over the past few decades these theories have been applied to many study systems that only share some geographic features with island systems. These features include spatial fragmentation, limited area, spatial and temporal isolation from adjacent parts of the system, and low connectivity between different parts within the system, to mention just a few. These systems vary in their form, the matrix that surrounds them, the factors defining their borders, the extent of insularity they impose on the different taxa, and their geological similarity to different types of actual islands. Here, I seek to understand whether such island‐like systems (ILS) function biologically as true islands. In the first part, I describe the wide diversity of ILS suggested in the literature and the variation in the features that define their insularity. In the second part, I review the extent to which the main theories of island biology are applicable to these systems: species–area and species–isolation relationships, community composition, evolutionary radiations, and the extent of endemism and genetic diversity. In the third and final part, I suggest a new conceptual framework within which to classify and study the biology of ILS, as well as practical future research directions. I conclude that the term ‘biological island’ is a multi‐faceted concept, loosely related to its geographical definition. As ILS are often less isolated than true islands, and their biological patterns are only partly similar to those of true islands (and even this is true only for some ILS) the use of the term ‘island’ to describe any isolated habitat is therefore inappropriate.}}

The water column conditions locally experience notable fluctuations across the year, mostly driven by biannual monsoon seasons. Salinity, temperature, and pH often reach extreme values, unsustainable for the majority of the marine fauna. Therefore, the biodiversity of the benthic macrofauna in this peculiar habitat is remarkably low. In particular, a single sponge species new to science was found solely populating this characteristic brackish lake during our last survey in August 2018. Spongilla manconii sp. nov. is a new Porifera species described here. It belongs to an exclusively freshwater taxon and seems to have acquired adaptive traits to tolerate extreme peaks of temperature and salinity. The mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacers 1 and 2 (ITSs) gene markers were used for barcoding tagging and phylogenetic analyses. The new species revealed large genetic distances and separate clustering in the tree topology, with respect to other reference spongillid sequences from various geographic areas.

Detecting subtle genetic differentiation at small scales relevant to marine protected areas is challenging in benthic populations due to large effective population sizes, general lack of resolution in genetic markers, potential microbial associations, and because barriers to dispersal often remain elusive. We genotyped the sponge species Suberites diversicolor using double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (4,826 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs), compared it to same individuals using single markers (COI and ITS), and used previously published data on the associated microbial communities from a subset of the same locations. Studying S. diversicolor from marine lakes at different spatial scales (1-1,400 km), along a gradient of connection to the surrounding sea, and with different environmental regimes, we did not detect strong effects of geographic distance, permeability of seascape barriers or local environments in shaping population genetic structure. All markers detected two major lineages and geographic clustering over a large spatial scale. However, with the SNP dataset we provide new evidence of strong population structure even at scales <10km (average FST = 0.56), where previously none was detected. A lack of congruence between host population structure and microbial community patterns of S. diversicolor from the same locations was observed, suggesting they are on different eco-evolutionary tracks. Our results call for a reassessment of poorly dispersing benthic organisms that were previously assumed to be highly connected based on low resolution markers.}}

All three lakes harbored Mastigias papua, Lenmakana and Keramat lakes also harbored Aurelia sp., and Keramat had a third jellyfish species Cassiopea ornata. However, at Karawapop the jellyfish were not found on the water surface during the first round of field work because of effects associated with the El Nino phenomenon at that time. As a result of the El Nino effect, at Keramat, brown Mastigias became white in May 2016. The three lakes have different tidal delays (30−120 min) and dampened tidal amplitude (62%) compared to the sea. The benthos was found to be dominated by bivalves (Brachidontes sp.), algae (Cladophora sp., or Halimeda sp.) and sponges (predominantly Haliclona spp. and Tethya spp.). In addition, species of the family Synaptidae (Holothuroidea) were abundant and spread over almost all the bottom of Karawapop Lake, while tube-worms of the Polychaeta class were identified in Keramat Lake. Although these lakes are identified as a conservation area, currently there is no management activity in Lenmakana and Karawapop Lakes, despite the fact that the lakes are growing in popularity as a tourist site.

Our main goals were to compare the bacterial richness and composition of two sponge species (Suberites diversicolor and Cinachyrella australiensis) inhabiting both marine lakes and adjacent open coastal systems. Host species and habitat explained almost 59% of the variation in bacterial composition. There was a significant difference in composition between both host species. Within S. diversicolor, there was little discernible difference between bacterial communities inside and outside lakes. The bacterial community of this species was, furthermore, dominated (63% of all sequences) by three very closely related alphaproteobacterial taxa identified as belonging to the recently described order Kiloniellales. Cinachyrella australiensis, in contrast, hosted markedly different bacterial communities inside and outside lakes with very few shared abundant taxa. Cinachyrella australiensis in open habitat only shared 9.4% of OTUs with C. australiensis in lake habitat. Bacteria were thus both highly species specific and, in the case of C. australiensis, habitat specific.}}

Our main goal was to assess whether these morphospecies hosted distinct bacterial and archaeal communities and to what extent these differed from those found in lake water. A recently developed bioinformatic tool (PICRUSt) was used to predict metagenomic gene content of the studied communities. Compositionally, sponge samples clustered according to morphospecies as opposed to marine lake indicating that each morphospecies hosted distinct bacterial and archaeal communities. There were, however, also differences in higher taxon abundance among lakes. In the less connected lake, for example, both Cinachyrella morphospecies had higher levels of the order Synechococcales. With respect to metabolic gene content, although there were pronounced differences in predicted enrichment between both morphospecies, both were putatively enriched for KOs involved in pathways related to stress response, energy metabolism, environmental information processing and the production of secondary metabolites compared to prokaryote communities in water. These morphospecies may thus prove to be interesting sources of novel compounds of potential pharmaceutical and/or biotechnological importance.}}

Previous studies suggested the prevailing influence of the lake bathymetry, that is, the proportion of carbonates and grain size characteristics of the sediments, on the variability of the element composition of the lake sediments. To confirm previous assumptions and obtain a better understanding of the factors influencing sediment composition of this marine lake, the distribution of rare earth elements in sediments of the Lake Mir and the nearby Telascica Bay, as well as surrounding soils, was investigated. In the lake sediments, the sum of rare earth elements, including Y (hereinafter referred as ΣREY), ranged from 10.6 mg kg−1 to 25.3 mg kg−1; in the Telascica Bay sediments, ΣREY were higher compared to the lake and ranged from 56.4 mg kg−1 to 85.2 mg kg−1, while the highest ΣREY, from 83.3 mg kg−1 to 227 mg kg−1, were observed in soils surrounding the lake. Despite the difference in the levels of the rare earth elements, the REY normalized patterns and associated fractionation parameters (ΣLREE/ΣHREE, (La/Yb)N, and (Nd/Yb)N) showed similarities between the lake sediments and the surrounding soils, confirming a significant influence of local lithology on the lake composition.

It is considerably difficult to obtain clear answers to this question due to the following reasons. Marine organisms that reproduce by releasing numerous eggs and larvae are able to disperse over large distances and can therefore be distributed over large geographic areas. Such marine organisms have a large population size, gene flow between distant populations occurs frequently, and interspecies hybridization sometimes occurs (Kuriiwa et al., 2007). Even geographically well-separated populations may be connected genetically, because there are few barriers to prevent gene flow in the oceans (Mayr, 1954; Palumbi, 1994). In contrast to the open ocean environment, the marine lakes of Palau (Western Caroline Islands), which are surrounded entirely by land and isolated from the sea, provide unique local environments for genetic differentiation of marine organisms (Dawson and Hamner, 2005; Gotoh et al., 2009; Goto et al., 2011).

To examine evolutionary processes in marine lakes, we conducted population genetic analyses on marine lake and lagoon populations of the striped silverside, Atherinomorus endrachtensis, using two mitochondrial DNA markers differing in evolutionary rate, the cytochrome b gene and the control region. The analyses revealed that the amount of genetic diversity of marine lake populations is much lower than that of lagoon populations and high levels of genetic differentiation occur among marine lake and lagoon populations. The present study has shown that marine lake populations have been completely isolated and have differentiated from lagoon populations, and each marine lake population is experiencing different evolutionary processes.

We conducted field surveys during 2004–2007 and collected zooplankton samples from eight coastal areas and 16 marine lakes. The marine lakes in the islands of Palau are limnologically classified into two types, meromictic and holomictic lakes. Species diversity indices (Margalef’s species richness d′, Shannon–Wiener index H′, and Simpson’s dominance) were measured at each sampling site. The copepod community structure was analyzed using multivariate analyses, hierarchical cluster analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) from the PRIMER package. A total of 36 copepod taxa were identified to the genus or species level from Calanoida, Cyclopoida, Harpacticoida, and Poecilostomatoida. Multivariate analysis based on the Bray–Curtis similarity index revealed that copepod assemblages could be classified into three different groups according to their habitat: (I) meromictic lakes, (II) holomictic lakes with an exceptionally shallow and flat basin (type A holomictic lakes), (III) holomictic lakes with a deep basin (type B holomictic lakes), and all coastal areas. The meromictic lakes were characterized by markedly decreased species diversity (d′ = 0.15, H′ = 0.41) in which only two brackish-water species, Bestiolina similis and Oithona dissimilis, were dominant. Type A holomictic lakes were characterized by relatively low levels of species diversity (d′ = 1.25, H′ = 1.35). In contrast, type B holomictic lakes were characterized by relatively high levels of species diversity, which was comparable to that of coastal areas. This result indicated that zooplankton assemblages in the type B holomictic lakes were closely related to a coastal community. The present study showed that the species diversity of pelagic copepods varies according to the level of isolation and the local environmental conditions for each marine lake.}}

Consequently, the potential for intra-specific variation in the behavior of marine zooplankton has received insufficient attention and conclusions of adaptation remain poorly substantiated. Intra-specific comparison of patterns of migration and behavior for seven populations of golden jellyfish, Mastigias (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae), inhabiting isolated marine lakes and semi-enclosed lagoon coves in Palau document population specific differences in patterns of horizontal migration, vertical migration, pulse rate, swimming speed, and turning behavior. Evidence was found for symplesiomorphic behaviors, canalization, exaptation, adaptation, and probably once-deleterious traits. Behavioral evolution likely proceeded via, at least, relaxation of selection, trade-offs with morphology, and natural selection effected by predation. Behavioral patterns also may change with ontogeny. Geographic variation in the behavior of marine plankton therefore can be substantial and patterns of evolution complex.

Microbial communities consume oxygen, alter biogeochemistry and compress habitat in aquatic ecosystems, yet our understanding of these microbial–biogeochemical–ecological interactions is limited by a lack of systematic analyses of low-oxygen ecosystems. Marine lakes provide an ideal comparative system, as they range from well-mixed holomictic lakes to stratified, anoxic, meromictic lakes that vary in their vertical extent of anoxia. We examined microbial communities inhabiting six marine lakes and one ocean site using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Microbial richness and evenness was typically highest in the anoxic monimolimnion of meromictic lakes, with common marine bacteria present in mixolimnion communities replaced by anoxygenic phototrophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria and SAR406 in the monimolimnion. These sharp changes in community structure were linked to environmental gradients (constrained variation in redundancy analysis=68%–76%) – particularly oxygen and pH. However, in those lakes with the steepest oxygen gradients, salinity and dissolved nutrients were important secondary constraining variables, indicating that subtle but substantive differences in microbial communities occur within similar low-oxygen habitats. Deterministic processes were a dominant influence on whole community assembly (all nearest taxon index values >4), demonstrating that the strong environmental gradients present in meromictic marine lakes drive microbial community assembly.}}

Focusing on marine lakes of the Palau Islands, we investigated the effect of geographical isolation on Sphaeramia orbicularis, a coastal fish inhabiting marine lakes and lagoons. We collected a total of 157 individuals from three meromictic marine lakes and three lagoon sites, and analyzed the genetic diversity and differentiation of the populations based on complete sequences of the mitochondrial control region (824 bp). The analyses show that the genetic diversity of marine lake populations is much lower than that of lagoon populations. Moreover, a mismatch distribution analysis suggests that marine lake populations have experienced a decrease followed by a rapid expansion of their population size. These results reveal that marine lake populations have experienced severe founder and/or bottleneck events during the last thousand to tens of thousand years. Pairwise ΦST values ranged from 0.531 to 0.848 between marine lake and lagoon populations and from 0.429 to 0.870 among marine lake populations, indicating a high degree of genetic differentiation. We speculate that such peripatric differentiation between marine lake and lagoon populations was caused by a small number of individuals colonizing the lakes from the lagoon (founder event) followed by repetitive bottleneck events, such as those generated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). So far, such high genetic divergences in extremely short geographical ranges (approximately 150–250 m) have scarcely been reported for marine organisms. We suggest that the marine lake is one of the good model of geographical isolation in marine organisms and each marine lake population is in the early stages of speciation.}}

A range of habitats has been surveyed, varying in distance offshore (with decreasing salinity, turbidity, sedimentation and nutrient load): fringing reefs along the mainland shore, offshore patch reefs, delta-front barrier reefs, and uplifted atolls. The atolls consist of limestone rock and contain shallow enclosed marine lakes with a unique marine biota. The various marine environments at NE Kalimantan have enabled the selection of taxa and sites that can be used for future research on climate change records (e.g. corals, sponges and molluscs), molecular (genetic) divergence within species between separated populations, and environmental effects on species diversity.

Sponge specimens were sampled in five marine lakes in Borneo and Papua and one open sea habitat in Taiwan. Prokaryotic communities of S. diversicolor were dominated by members assigned to the Proteobacteria (particularly Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and Cyanobacteria, which together made up from 78 to 87% of sequences in all samples. The dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in most samples, OTUs 1 and 3, were both assigned to the alphaproteobacterial order Rhodospirillales with OTU-1 dominant in the marine lakes of Berau and Papua and OTU-3 in Taiwan. OTU-3 was also largely absent from Papuan samples but present in all Berau samples. Compositionally, S. diversicolor samples clustered according to geographical location with the main axis of variation separating marine lake samples collected in Berau from those collected in Papua and the second axis of variation separating open sea samples collected in Taiwan from all marine lake samples. In addition, our results suggest that the degree of lake connectivity to the open sea also influences prokaryotic composition. Although previous studies have shown that sponge-associated microbial communities tend to be stable across different geographical and environmental gradients, in the present study, both geography and local environmental conditions were significant predictors of variation in prokaryotic community composition of S. diversicolor.}}

The Palau Islands include approximately 70 marine lakes formed by the rising of ancient coral reefs. In some marine lakes that are completely isolated from outer lagoons, seawater can soak through minute pores in the limestone surrounding the lakes, causing tidal changes to occur. However, marine organisms cannot enter or exit marine lakes. Based on our previous evolutionary genetic analyses, certain fish (in Atherinidae, Apogonidae, and Gobiidae) and mussels (in Mytilidae) exhibit distinct patterns of evolution between marine lake and outer lagoon populations, and also among marine lake populations. Dawson and Jacobs (2001) reported that three distinct species of moon jellyfishes are distributed in Palau; Aurelia sp. 3 and Aurelia sp. 6 inhabit outer lagoons and Aurelia sp. 4 inhabits marine lakes. We surveyed and collected jellyfish and confirmed that the species are highly differentiated both genetically and morphologically. Based on additional comparative observations of Aurelia sp. 4 and Aurelia sp. 3, the former clearly exhibits specific morphological and ethological characters adapted to the environmental conditions that characterize calm marine lakes. Based on geological estimates of marine lake formation, such adaptive evolution in jellyfish occurred rapidly between 5,000 and 15,000 years ago.}}

These effects are significant but complex at the upper margins of expanding oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), where deoxygenation and biogeochemical feedbacks to low dissolved oxygen (DO) are regulated by biological production and consumption of DO via gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR). We used ‘marine lakes’—bodies of seawater surrounded by land—as a natural experimental system for examining the environmental factors that dictate coupling and de-coupling between GPP and CR. Distinct gradients in DO (from fully oxygenated to anoxic conditions), temperature, light, quantity and quality of organic matter, presence of key nutrients, and microbial community structure occur across multiple stratified meromictic lakes and well-mixed holomictic marine lakes present in Palau. We found consistently high GPP rates in stratified meromictic lakes (>10 mmol O2 m-3 d-1)—especially near the chemocline, where nutrients diffuse upwards from anoxic waters—and a wider range of rates in well-mixed lakes (0.350 to 57.9 mmol O2 m-3 d-1). In contrast to GPP, CR rates were typically lower and less variable across different depths and lakes. Most depths in most lakes were therefore net autotrophic (i.e., net community production [NCP] > 0). However, experimental additions of ammonium (5 μM) and labile organic carbon (100 μM) had strong effects on CR, resulting in (i) several-fold increases in CR, (ii) larger increases in CR in meromictic lakes with chemoclines near the surface, and (iii) the occurrence of net heterotrophy and DO consumption. Our results are indicative of several biogeochemical feedback mechanisms to deoxygenation present at the upper margins of shoaling OMZs that are governed by nutrient turnover. In marine lakes, these feedbacks can have strong effects on nutrient uptake and the production and consumption of oxygen, with implications for carbon, nutrient, and oxygen cycling throughout large areas of the ocean.}}

We used a novel approach, a REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle, to quantify jellyfish distribution, abundance and habitat, and compared these findings to traditional methods. Midday acoustic surveys showed jellyfish distribution was patchy and the population resided mainly on the eastern side of the lake, as it is known that jellyfish migrate eastward towards the sun. Highest vertical densities of jellyfish were at 6–7m, potentially to mitigate UV damage or photoinhibition of their photosymbionts, suggesting a coupling exists between their vertical distribution and water properties. Abundance estimates of jellyfish were ~2.75 and ~7.1 million (~2 million excluding bell diameters}}

Blooms of scyphozoan species are common worldwide and can have numerous deleterious consequences on the marine ecosystem. Four scyphozoan species, Aurelia coerulea, Cyanea nozakii, Nemopilema nomurai, and Rhopilema esculentum, form large blooms in Chinese seas. In this study, we analyzed the bacterial communities associated with these four jellyfish based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the bacterial communities associated with each scyphozoan species were significantly different from each other and from those of the surrounding seawater. There were no significant differences between the bacterial communities associated with different body parts of the four scyphozoan jellyfish. Core bacteria in various compartments of the four scyphozoan taxa comprised 57 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), dominated by genera Mycoplasma, Vibrio, Ralstonia, Tenacibaculum, Shingomonas and Phyllobacterium. FAPROTAX function prediction revealed that jellyfish could influence microbially mediated biogeochemical cycles, compound degradation and transmit pathogens in regions where they proliferate. Finally, Six genera of potentially pathogenic bacteria associated with the scyphozoans were detected: Vibrio, Mycoplasma, Ralstonia, Tenacibaculum, Nautella, and Acinetobacter. Our study suggests that blooms of these four common scyphozoans may cause jellyfish species-specific impacts on element cycling in marine ecosystems, and serve as vectors of pathogenic bacteria to threaten other marine organisms and human health.}}

Coral reefs are formed by a highly successful yet environmentally sensitive symbiotic association between animals (cnidarians; scleractinian corals) and protists (dinoflagellate algae; zooxanthellae in the genus  Symbiodinium ). The term  coral  is generally used to denote the holobiont, i.e. both partners in the symbiosis. On a healthy coral reef, macroalgae are generally sparse and coral cover is high, but the balance can be tipped to communities dominated by fleshy algae by nutrient inputs that promote algal growth in the otherwise oligotrophic waters, or by reduction of normally high grazing pressure (Littler & Littler, 1984).  Coral reefs are vital resources for millions of humans in tropical, especially developing countries, who depend on them for fisheries (Cesar, 2000; Sadovy, 2005; Vincent, 2006), tourism income (Brander  et al ., 2007), storm protection (UNEP-WCMC, 2006), and sometimes structural materials (Berg  et al ., 1998; Mallik, 1999).

In this study, organic matter cycle and its impact on distribution of trace metals in the marine lake Mir, located on Dugi Otok Island, in the central part of the eastern Adriatic Sea, was investigated for the first time. Studied marine lake is small, isolated, shallow basin, with limited communication with the open sea. Intense spatial and seasonal variations of organic matter, dissolved and particulate (DOC, POC), and dissolved trace metals concentrations in the water column of the Lake are governed predominantly by natural processes. Enhanced oxygen consumption in the Lake during summer season, high DOC and POC concentrations and low redox potential result in occasional occurrence of anoxic conditions in the bottom layers with appearance of sulfur species. Speciation modeling showed that dissolved trace metals Cu, Pb and Zn, are mostly bound to organic matter, while Cd, Co and Ni are present predominantly as free ions and inorganic complexes. Trace metals removal from the water column and their retention in the sediment was found to depend on the nature of the relationship between specific metal and organic or inorganic phases, sulfides, Fe-oxyhydroxydes or biogenic calcite. The above is reflected in the composition of the sediments, which are, in addition to influence of karstic background and bathymetry of the basin, significantly affected by accumulation of detritus at the bottom of the Lake.}}

While having been extensively studied in saline and marine systems (e.g. oxygen minimum zones, the Black Sea, and Mono Lake), microbes are not well understood in marine lakes, especially those located in Palau. The marine lakes of Palau are ideal for microbial ecology because these unique habitats act like oceanic mesocosms – making studies of microbes found in other saline systems (e.g. the ocean) much more feasible. Using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) and a next generation sequencing technique, 454 pyrosequencing, the richness, diversity, and composition of microbial communities in the marine lakes was analyzed. Lake bacterial groups showed a strongly supported dissimilarity (100% for ~11% similarity) between those from all but one low oxygen ( 10 μM) depths, and bacterial community similarities decreased with increasing depth (decreasing oxygen) in the meromictic lakes. While some bacterial groups were ubiquitous among the lakes, ones that participate in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur were found in the low oxygen (<5 μM) waters of the meromictic lakes. This research helps show the significance of marine lakes to microbial ecology as well as to understanding other saline systems.}}

It comprises an open reading frame of 1,563 nucleotides encoding BmaN2 of 520 amino acids and belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 36 (GH13_36). This α-amylase has a maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 60 °C with a specific activity of 28.7 U mg−1. The BmaN2 activity is enhanced strongly by Ca2+ but inhibited by EDTA. BmaN2 also exhibits high catalytic efficiency on soluble starch with kcat/KM value of 14.1 mL mg−1 s−1. Despite no additional starch-binding domain, BmaN2 is able to hydrolyze various raw starches, such as wheat, corn, cassava, potato, rice, sago, and canna, in which granular wheat is the preferred substrate for BmaN2. These characteristics indicate that BmaN2 is a promising raw starch degrading enzyme within the subfamily GH13_36.}}

Elemental and stable isotope (δ13C) data indicate that the sedimentary organic matter is primarily derived from vascular plant remains (65–90%) and would form a type 2 kerogen. A bacterial layer at the oxic-anoxic interface in the water column may play an important role in the rapid recycling of algal-derived organic matter from the highly productive surface waters.

The major postdepositional change in the sedimentary organic matter is carbohydrate biodegradation, as shown by 13C NMR. Lignin and aliphatic substances are preserved in the sediments. Dissolved organic matter in pore waters is primarily composed of carbohydrates, reflecting the degradation of sedimentary carbohydrates. Rate constants for organic carbon degradation and sulfate reduction in sediments of the lake are about 10 × lower than in other anoxic sediments. This may reflect the vascular plant source and partly degraded nature of the organic matter reaching the sediments of the lake.

Elemental results from sediment cores and stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) studies of shells from the sediments indicate probable climatic or ecological fluctuations affecting the depositional environment of the lake between 80 and 110 yr ago. The high sedimentation rate and stable environment of Jellyfish Lake make it a possible environment for studies of climatic fluctuations during the Holocene.}}

Both lake water δD (δD Lake ) and δD Dino  could be expressed as a quadratic function of either precipitation or lake water salinity. δD Dino  values were used to reconstruct past hydrological changes of the region. Long-term variations in the strength and sign of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) since the Little Ice Age (LIA, ∼1450–1850 A.D.) and during the early Holocene (∼7–9kyr BP) appeared to dominate decadal variability, and indicate very dry conditions during the LIA. Early Holocene δD Dino  values were on average ∼10‰ higher than those of recent centuries, which we interpret as a result of millennial scale hydrologic and water mass changes on a global level. The similar ∼35‰ range of δD changes during the early Holocene and last several centuries imply a similar range of decadal-centennial hydrologic variability during those two climate regimes. Our results indicate that a correlation exists between solar irradiance levels and tropical Pacific climate.}}

The species studied in those case studies were jellyfish in marine lakes, corals in acidified bays, seagrass, mangrove propagules, mussels and oysters, prawns, some estuarine fish larvae, the copepod Calanus finmarchius in the North Sea, sea turtles in the Coral Sea, and the ornate spiny lobster Panulirus ornatus in the Southeast Asia archipelago. The spatial scales for self-recruitment and connectivity vary with the species from a few m to 10,000 km, and the temporal scales vary from one to three generations. These studies suggest that, with increasing physical openness of a given site for a given species, self-recruiting increasingly relies on the behaviour of the species. Estuarine and coastal systems thus are simultaneously bounded and unbounded depending on the sites and the species considered and, although often ignored, the integration of oceanographic and behavioural understanding is increasingly required. This paper has shown the importance of understanding the hydrological and ecological dynamics with unbounded boundaries in creating the connectivity between parts of the aquatic continuum from the river catchment to the open seas.}}

Using high-resolution, in situ DO time-series collected over the course of a year in a novel marine ecosystem (Jellyfish Lake, Palau), we show that DO declined throughout the marine lake and subsequently recovered in the upper water column. These shifts were accompanied by variations in water temperature and were correlated to changes in wind, precipitation, and especially sea surface height that occurred during the 2015–2016 El Nino-Southern Oscillation event. Multiple approaches used to calculate rates of community respiration, net community production, and gross primary production from DO changes showed that DO consumption and production did not accelerate nor collapse; instead, their variance increased during lake deoxygenation and recovery, and then stabilized. Spatial and temporal variations in rates were significantly related to climatic variability and changes in DO, and causality testing indicated that these relationships were both correlative and causative. Our data indicate that climatic, physical, and biogeochemical properties and processes collectively regulated DO, producing linked feedbacks that drove DO decline and recovery.}}

The single individual from Laguna Joyuda, collected in 2002, was previously misidentified as Phyllorhiza (Agassiz, 1862) and Mastigias has not since been recorded there, while a large population of Mastigias was observed in No Name Key in 2009 and 2010 and may have been present for decades. Identification as Mastigias for both sampling sites was confirmed by molecular systematic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and ribosomal 16S (16S). Sequences from both molecular markers were identical for all individuals sampled from Puerto Rico and the Florida Keys. Phylogenetic analysis of COI indicated that the introduced Mastigias were most closely related to Mastigias sp. 1 (Dawson, 2005) from Kakaban, Indonesia (Kimura 2-parameter sequence divergence = 1.1%) and distantly related to Mastigias papua (Lesson, 1830) from Palau (6.4-7.2%) and Mastigias sp. 2 (Dawson, 2005) from Papua New Guinea (9.8%). Therefore, the source region may lie somewhere in the central Indo-Malayan region, though determining an exact source region is not possible at this time. While the invasion vector is unclear, possible mechanisms include commercial shipping, mobile oil platforms and live rock transport. These are the first two confirmed records of Mastigias in the Atlantic basin and the second confirmed identification of the genus occurring outside of the native range, after Hawaii.}}

Unlike other known marine lakes from polar areas, which communicate with the sea by water percolation at the surface, Mogilnoe has a subterranean connection with the sea like tropical and subtropical anchialine lakes. Similarly to some other marine lakes, Mogilnoe has traditionally been considered to be biologically isolated from the sea and subject to little change. We review the current status of the physical features, zooplankton and benthos of Mogilnoe and trace changes that have occurred in the lake since the start of observations in 1894. The anaerobic bottom water layer has expanded by 100 %, while the upper freshwater layer has diminished by 40 %. The species diversity of zooplankton and macrobenthos has halved. The occurrence of Atlantic cod likens Mogilnoe to some other Arctic marine lakes while the presence of large flocks of sea anemones, scyphomedusae and suberitid sponges makes it similar to tropical anchialine lakes. Lake Mogilnoe is not entirely biologically isolated; accidental introduction of species from the sea does occur. We argue that the idealised model of an isolated steady-state ecosystem can be applied to a marine lake with caution. A model of fluctuating abiotic environment and partial biological isolation portrays the real situation better.}}

The effects of deoxygenation on animals are generally detrimental; however, some sponges (Porifera) exhibit hypoxic and anoxic tolerance through currently unknown mechanisms. Sponges harbor highly specific microbiomes, which can include microbes with anaerobic capabilities. Sponge-microbe symbioses must also have persisted through multiple anoxic/hypoxic periods throughout Earth’s history. Since sponges lack key components of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway responsible for hypoxic responses in other animals, it was hypothesized that sponge tolerance to deoxygenation may be facilitated by its microbiome. To test this hypothesis, we determined the microbial composition of sponge species tolerating seasonal anoxia and hypoxia in situ in a semienclosed marine lake, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We discovered a high degree of cryptic diversity among sponge species tolerating seasonal deoxygenation, including at least nine encrusting species of the orders Axinellida and Poecilosclerida. Despite significant changes in microbial community structure in the water, sponge microbiomes were species specific and remarkably stable under varied oxygen conditions, which was further explored for Eurypon spp. 2 and Hymeraphia stellifera. However, some symbiont sharing occurred under anoxia. At least three symbiont combinations, all including large populations of Thaumarchaeota, corresponded with deoxygenation tolerance, and some combinations were shared between some distantly related hosts. We propose hypothetical host-symbiont interactions following deoxygenation that could confer deoxygenation tolerance.  IMPORTANCE The oceans have an uncertain future due to anthropogenic stressors and an uncertain past that is becoming clearer with advances in biogeochemistry. Both past and future oceans were, or will be, deoxygenated in comparison to present conditions. Studying how sponges and their associated microbes tolerate deoxygenation provides insights into future marine ecosystems. Moreover, sponges form the earliest branch of the animal evolutionary tree, and they likely resemble some of the first animals. We determined the effects of variable environmental oxygen concentrations on the microbial communities of several demosponge species during seasonal anoxia in the field. Our results indicate that anoxic tolerance in some sponges may depend on their symbionts, but anoxic tolerance was not universal in sponges. Therefore, some sponge species could likely outcompete benthic organisms like corals in future, reduced-oxygen ecosystems. Our results support the molecular evidence that sponges and other animals have a Neoproterozoic origin and that animal evolution was not limited by low-oxygen conditions.}}

The marine Bakalskoye Lake (Ukraine) was studied in 2000-2012. The paper considers changing crustaceans within the context of the lagoon changes. A sharp drop of salinity occurred in 2004 due to a changed wind rose because the strong winds of Western direction began to dominate, and as a result, washing away of the spit began to be more intensive; and marine water inflow into the lake increased. The structure of primary productivity has changed completely; the total primary production decreased. A list of crustacean species found in the lake includes 19 species. In 2004 there was a change of the composition of crustaceans due to three factors - a change of salinity, an increase of erosion, and massive transport of marine organisms into the lake. Integral characteristics of zooplankton also significantly changed. Impact of climate change on crustaceans is not only direct, but through an extensive network of intermediate effects which are discussed. The study results are of more than local relevance; it has a general ecological importance because can help to better understand that the realizations of general climate change impacts on local level are diverse.}}

The investigation covered the major variables: salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and alkalinity, some nutrients, organic carbon, and iodide, iodate and organic-I. Lake Mir was found to be meso-trophic, with dynamic nutrient cycling of a magnitude usually associated with the temperate zone but within a Mediterranean clime. An essentially U-shaped pattern exists in the plot of nutrient concentration versus time for the June–November period studied. Together, the major variables and the nutrient chemistry confirm that Lake Mir is essentially isolated from the nearby (90 m) Adriatic seawater, and this also may explain the meso-trophic nature of the lake, with dry and wet deposition as the source of the extra nutrient. It is of note that iodate was essentially absent from Mir during the sampling period. This appears to be consistent with iodine's behaviour in the oceans in general, where iodate is reduced generally as a result of the presence of the biota. The chemistry of iodine in Lake Mir is consequently dominated by changes in iodide and organic-I concentrations, with the latter at higher concentrations than those found in seawater. Even so, the total iodine concentration in Mir is only about one-quarter of that in the adjacent Adriatic seawater, and again it is argued that this is probably a function of Lake Mir's isolation.}}

We document the introduction, proliferation and establishment of a non-native sea anemone species in an isolated tropical marine lake, a marine ‘island’. From 2003–2012, we gathered samples to identify the introduced species and used transect and photo-quadrat surveys to describe its abundance, distribution, and any associations with native species or habitats. The non-native sea anemone was first found at the tourist entry into the lake in 2003 and identified as Exaiptasia pallida (Agassiz 1864), a species with zooxanthellae endosymbionts. Temporal patterns of tourism, the spatial extent of the sea anemone in 2003, and genetic analyses of the symbiont were consistent with the early stages of introduction. Subsequent expansion of E. pallida throughout the lake occurred within six years. The native species assemblages that were invaded by E. pallida were heterogeneous among surveys and habitats. Overall, there were few correlations that were significant between percent cover of E. pallida and native species; most significant associations were negative; the majority were on mangrove roots. There was one positive association between E. pallida and a native sponge. No significant relationship was found between the abundance of E. pallida and native species diversity. The rapid expansion of E. pallida but dearth of strong ecosystem effects presents a case study of invasive species in a tropical marine habitat where consequences are not directly proportional to invasive abundance. Whether this outcome is stable and representative of other species introduced into marine lakes, or elsewhere in marine systems, remains to be seen.}}

Acoustic surveys showed the presence of large numbers of sprat ( Sprattus sprattus ), preyed upon by mackerel  Scomber scombrus . The sprat formed dense schools during the day and dispersed at night. Zooplankton were widely distributed within the lough, although absent below the oxythermocline. However, echo traces showed clear volumes, indicating an absence of zooplankton, surrounding the daytime sprat schools. Pumped sampling of the zooplankton at different depths, close to and away from the sprat schools, confirmed that those volumes of water that appeared acoustically clear were largely devoid of macro zooplankton (92.7% reduction overall). Comparison of clear areas with adjacent areas showed that almost all decapod larvae and calanoid copepods and most bivalve larvae were absent. The differences for cladocerans were also significant but for gastropod larvae they were not significant. Large calanoid copepods were much less abundant in the clear areas and their size distribution had changed. We conclude that the sprat schools had rapidly depleted their surroundings of zooplankton, suggesting that fish within the schools may be substantially food-limited. Dispersal at night, when visual predators are less efficient, may enable the sprat to feed more effectively. Thus, although schooling may confer benefits to individual fish there are concomitant disadvantages in terms of food depletion. The reduction in zooplankton as a result of heavy grazing by sprat within the enclosed lough may affect the phytoplankton, with significant effects upon the ecology of Lough Hyne.}}

It is a karstic depression with an area of 10.276 m2, filled with seawater with a maximum depth of 15 m. The lake is stratified during the spring–summer season, both thermally and in its salinity. There are oxic upper water layer and anoxic deeper layer. The mixolimnion varies seasonally in depth and thickness for about 1 m due to influence of meteorological conditions (temperature, wind, rainfall), which also affect the dynamics between the water layers. Rogoznica Lake can be considered as a system with both meromictic and holomictic conditions, which alternate seasonally and affect the lake’s ecology. Anoxic water is usually located below 10 m depth, and it is characterized by high concentrations of reduced sulphur species, nutrients and dissolved organic carbon. In anoxic water and laminated sediment, enrichment of trace metals, especially those that accumulate in sulphidic environment (Fe, Mo), is found. According to sedimentary enrichment of Mo (up to 81 mg kg−1), the lake can be classified as typical anoxic and meromictic environment. Extreme ecological conditions, which prevail in the lake, control the phytoplankton and zooplankton activities. Diatoms are the dominant microphytoplankton group, while oligotrich ciliates and copepods, the heterotrophic zooplankton organisms, play an important role and control the food web of the lake, especially in the post-holomictic–anoxic period. Ciliates by grazing on phototrophic sulphur bacteria at the chemocline transfer organic carbon to higher trophic levels, from anoxic to oxic conditions.}}

The population density of P. nobilis was estimated in the lake with line transect sampling. Individuals of the youngest age class (small) had peak densities in the 1 to 3 m bathymetric zone and their densities were higher in poorly sorted sediments. Older (large) individuals (belonging to all age classes except the first one, 9 to 11 mo) had peak densities in the 11 to 13 m bathymetric zone. No P. nobilis was found deeper than 22 m. The absence of large individuals in shallow waters may partly be explained by illegal fishing. There are several hypotheses proposed to explain the lack of small individuals in deeper areas, but no defini- tive explanation is offered. In Lake Vouliagmeni, P. nobilis densities were high, although marine sea- grass was completely absent. Thus, P. nobilis does not actually require seagrass meadows, as stated by many authors, and it may exist in large numbers in bare soft-sediment areas as well. P. nobilis grew fast, mostly during the first 3 yr of life, and may live beyond 15 yr. By recording the exact location of each P. nobilis individual within 800 m 2 transects, as a pair of coordinates, the exact spa- tial distribution was defined and aggregation indices were calculated. P. nobilis had an aggregated dispersion, but no evidence for preferential settlement near adults or previously-settled individuals was found. The aggregated dispersion of P. nobilis probably relates to the patchiness of the local environment. The size of P. nobilis population in Lake Vouliagmeni was estimated to be 8501 ± 4395 (mean ± 1 SD) individuals, of which 4355 ± 3460 belonged to the first age class and 4146 ± 1405 belonged to all other age classes.}}

A substantial population of the species was studied in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The population density and the spatial distribution of  P. jacobaeus  were estimated in the lake with line transect sampling by SCUBA diving, a method not previously used for scallop density estimations. Individuals of the first size class (small) were mainly restricted to shallow waters (4–8m), while individuals of the second size class (large) were mainly restricted to deeper waters (>12m). Possible reasons for this size-separation were: (1) the most appropriate settlement substrate for pediveligers was in shallow waters, (2) the strong summer thermocline in the lake may have induced the selection of the shallow and warm bottoms of the lake as settlement areas, (3) intraspecific competition between adults and pediveligers, and (4) the high fishing mortality of large individuals in shallow waters. On the hypothesis that successful recruitment of  P. jacobaeus  occurred mostly in the shallow areas of the lake, it was deduced that  P. jacobaeus  gradually migrated, as they grew, from the shallow settlement fields of the lake to the deeper areas. The density of large individuals was associated with depth and the degree of scatter (QD φ ) of the granule size frequencies. Higher densities of large individuals were found deeper and in poorly sorted sediments (QD φ >1.0). The size of large individuals was positively correlated with depth. The size of  P. jacobaeus  population in Lake Vouliagmeni was estimated.}}

Females spawned throughout the year in 1982–1983, but spawning peaked in February–March. A number of females spawned early and unsuccessfully in August, 1982. This event was followed in October by a reduction in adult density, and it may have caused late recruitment the following summer.  Under natural conditions in Sweetings Pond, O. briareus occupied cavities underneath a variety of benthic formations. In field choice experiments with artificial dens, adult O. briareus displayed minimum cavity length and diameter requirements. Restricted entrances were not preferred, perhaps due to the availability of material with which O. briareus could block their den entrances. A tactile examination of the cavity was important in selection, but visual discrimination was also involved; translucent dens were completely avoided in favor of opaque ones. Certain sponge species were rarely occupied by O. briareus because they lacked sufficient cavity space underneath. When artificial dens were placed underneath these sponges they were occupied.  Den defense was examined with a nearest neighbor experiment in which three pairs of artificial dens were placed in a study area. Dens were set 0, 15 and 50 cm apart and the frequency with which both dens of a pair were simultaneously occupied was recorded. The contiguous dens were never simultaneously occupied, whereas the other two pairs were simultaneously occupied with approximately equal frequency. Direct observations of intraspecific interactions confirmed the small size of the defended area.  Abundant predatory fishes probably limit Octopus populations off the Eleuthera coast, and the absence of such fishes from Sweetings Pond may account for the high O. briareus density there. Though not subject to interspecific predation, lake O. briareus required the protection of dens due to cannibalism. Only a small minority of benthic formations in the lake were consistently occupied in 1982–1983, and enriching areas with artificial dens increased local density. This suggests that dens were limiting in Sweetings Pond. With suitable cavities so widely spaced, den defense probably did not influence density apart from limiting occupation to one octopus per cavity. No Octopus occupied artificial dens in a coastal enrichment experiment, implying that dens were not limiting off the coast.}}

Two periods were recognized during the one-year investigation: one euhaline-mesotrophic from December to May and one hyperhaline-  eutrophic from June to November. Nutrient limitation appears to have been important in defining the lakes’ seasonal  phytoplankton composition. Phosphate was most likely limiting from October to December, silicate from January to April,  and nitrogen from June to September when nitrate was depleted. Diatoms were most abundant in November to January,  when temperature and salinity were low and nitrate and ammonium were high. They collapsed in March when silicate was  depleted. Amphora, Navicula, and other naviculoid diatoms were the most frequent genera.  Nitzschia longissima  was the  most abundant species. Dinoflagellate dominance began in June in Mala Solina and in March in Velika Solina. It continued  while temperature, salinity, phosphate, and silicate were high.  Oxyrrhis marina  was the most abundant dinoflagellate  (3.2 x 10 6  cells L -1 ). Nanophytoplankton was the dominant size fraction. Chroococoid cyanobacteria were most abundant  from May to October, reaching 2.9 x 10 7  cells L -1  in July. Both nanophytoplankton and small microphytoplankton, such as   Oxyrrhis, Scrippsiella , and  Tetraselmis , were most abundant under hyperhaline, N-depleted conditions.

Although the Mljet Lakes (MLs) are predominantly oligotrophic, mesotrophic conditions are present at depths below 20 m in the Small Lake (SL) and below 30 m in the Big Lake (BL), along with higher apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). Hypoxia at depths ≥ 25 m in SL and and ≥ 40 m in BL was observed between October 2009 and January 2010, and in SL in summer (July and September 2010). Significant differences (p  0.05) between the lakes. An intense and persistent pycnocline throughout the year, comparatively high water temperature, extended water renewal time and summer phytoplankton bloom were identified as physical and biological parameters which might have significantly contributed to increased frequency of hypoxic events in a shallow SL. Significantly (p < 0.05) higher ammonium concentration in SL, especially in its deep water, seems to be a long-term chemical feature related to the poor ventilation and higher sediment oxygen demand. At the current level of eutrophication and the present climate change trends, the MLs and similar systems may experience more persistent and intense stratification, which could further prevent mixing between upper and deep waters, likely leading to increasing duration of hypoxia and its negative impacts on the biodiversity of benthic communities.}}

Ongeim’l Tketau Lake in Palau, Hang Du I Lake in Vietnam, Kakaban Lake in Kalimantan, and Lenmakana Lake in Raja Ampat Papua are exotic tourist destinations because of presence of these biota in the lake. Water temperature is very influential on the life of a jellyfish because of its mutual symbiosis with brown algae zooxanthellae. Mastigias has totally disappeared in several places due to water temperature increasing, including Lenmakana Lake in the West Monsoon 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The absence of Mastigias in this lake will be explained by recorded logger data installed in the lake and at sea. Secondary data from NOAA and BMKG will be used to explain the condition of absence of jellyfish. Water lake temperature data showed an increase to 2.5oC when the Mastigias disappeared. Temperature increasing occur due to seasonal cycle patterns of lake water temperatures and weather cycles which change in time, the dry season occurs faster and the rainy season occurs slower. Conversely, in the West Monsoon 2019/2020, Mastigias still found in the lake. The rainy season which is 20 days faster than normal condition helps reduce the heat in West Monsoon.}}

Additionally, in one set of pore-water samples (core lo), the 613C of the X0, was also determined. The TA, H4Si04, POd3-, NH;+, and H,S increased with depth in the pore waters above anoxic bottom-water values. H,S values increased to 3.8 PM. In one case, both H,SiO, and POd3- concentrations increased to a maximum value and then decreased with depth, suggesting removal into solid phases. The H,SiO, concentrations are equal to or greater than pore-water values observed in sediments underlying upwelling areas. Pod3 - concentrations are, in general, lower than pore-water values from terrigenous nearshore areas but higher than nearshore carbonate pore-water values from Florida Bay or Bermuda. The Ca2+, Cl-, and Mg2+ : Cl- ratios show slight decreases in the top 15-20 cm, suggesting that authigenic carbonate may be forming. This suggestion is supported by the fact that the pore waters are saturated with respect to CaCO, due to the very high TAs. The 613C measurements of the pore-water X0, are from a shorter core. These measurements reach their most negative concentration at 72 cm and tilen become slightly heavier. This change is accompanied by a decrease in TA, suggesting the onset of methanogenesis at this location in this core.}}

Based on the analysis of their gut contents, medusae appeared to ingest less carbon than expected on the basis of their carbon content. To accurately define carbon ingestion by medusae, we determined the diet of Aurelia sp. 5 (Dawson and Jacobs, 2001) (Scyphozoa: Semaeostomeae) from Veliko Jezero by combining gut content and stable isotope analyses. During daytime, gut contents identified a mix of small copepods as the dominant prey (62%). In contrast, feeding models based on stable isotope values of medusae and their potential prey analyzed using Stable Isotope Analysis in R indicated appendicularians could have made the greatest contribution to Aurelia sp. 5 diet (14–78%), followed by calanoid copepods (0–50%) and fish larvae (0–43%). Because appendicularians and fish larvae are abundant with medusae at night near the bottom of the “lake” and contain more carbon than small copepods, we suggest diel movements of Aurelia sp. 5 and carbon content of prey determine the carbon assimilated by medusae, with night-time prey making a}}

This interest has been stimulated by the recognition that the type of elemental cycling that occurs in restrictive basins such as the Black Sea also occurs in many other environments. Examples include hydrothermal systems, estuarine and marine sediments, and other water columns with restrictive circulation. In addition, evidence that widespread anoxia has occurred in oceans of the geologic past “Fischer and Arthur, 1977; Jenkyns, 1980” requires us to obtain a better understanding of geochemical processes under such conditions.

Sediment samples from Jellyfish Lake were examined for the distribution of sulfur species and their isotopic signatures in order to gain a better understanding of sedimentary sulfur incorporation in Fe-poor environments. Surface samples were taken along a transect from a near-shore site to the center of the lake, and include a sample below oxic water, a sample below the chemocline layer, and samples below anoxic waters. Three additional samples were taken from a core, 2 m long, collected near the lake center. Sulfur to organic carbon weight ratios in all samples were lower than the expected value of 0.36 for normal marine sediment, probably because the lake water is deficient in reactive Fe to form iron sulfides. Total sulfur contents in the surface sediments indicated no changes with distance from shore; however, the sulfur content of the surface sample at the chemocline layer may be slightly higher. Total sulfur content increased with depth in the core and is inversely related to organic carbon content. Organic sulfur is the major sulfur species in the samples, followed in descending order by sulfate, disulfides and monosulfides. Sulfate sulfur isotope  δ  34 S-values are positive (from +20.56 to +12.04‰), reflecting the marine source of sulfate in Jellyfish Lake. Disulfide and monosulfide  δ  34 S-values are negative (from −25.07 to −7.60‰), because of fractionation during bacterial reduction of sulfate. Monosulfide  δ  34 S-values are somewhat higher than those of disulfides, and they are close to the  δ  34 S-values of organic sulfur. These results indicate that most of the organic sulfur is formed by reaction of bacteriogenic monosulfides, or possibly monosulfide-derived polysulfides, with organic matter in the sediment.}}

Since then, tourism in Palau has boomed, increasing 500% between 1986 and 1997. However, in December 1998, the golden-medusae disappeared. Apart from patchy occurrences between December 1998 and April 1999, the medusae have since been absent from the lake. Field measurements, including temperature and salinity depth profiles, Mastigias medusae population sizes, and the distribution of scyphistomae, in `Jellyfish Lake' between 1979 and 1999 were integrated with laboratory-based experiments on the effects of salinity, temperature, sunscreen and zooxanthellae enrichment on Mastigias scyphistomae or medusae. These studies indicated that the disappearance of medusae was due to physical changes in lake structure, including a substantial increase in temperature, initiated by the 1997–98 El Nino. Here, we describe these studies, the changes in Jellyfish Lake and their probable influence on the Mastigias.

Pseudokarst caves are of minor importance in anchialine cave habitat development, with some lava tubes being notable exceptions. Dissolution caves provide the most extensive, variable, and long-term environments for anchialine habitats. The Carbonate Island Karst Model (CIKM) allows dissolutional cave development in carbonate coasts to be understood as the interplay between freshwater and marine water mixing, sea-level change, rock maturity, and interaction with adjacent non-carbonate rocks. Glacioeustatic sea-level changes of the Quaternary have moved all coastal anchialine cave environments repeatedly through a vertical range of over 100 m, and modern anchialine environments could not develop at their current elevations until ~4,000 years ago when sea level reached its present position. Blue holes form by a variety of mechanisms, but the most common is upward stoping and collapse from deep dissolutional voids. As a result, they provide vertical connection between different levels of horizontal cave development produced by a variety of earlier sea-level positions. Blue holes are overprinted by successive sea-level fluctuations; each sea-level event adds complexity to the habitats within blue holes and the cave systems they connect. Blue holes can reach depths below the deepest glacioeustatic sea-level lowstand, and thereby provide a refugia for anchialine species when cave passages above are drained by Quaternary sea-level fall. Blue holes represent the most significant anchialine cave environment in the world, and may provide clues to anchialine cave species colonization and speciation events.}}

These habitats are currently subject to anthropogenic impacts that threaten their future existence. Previous research has shown strong genetic population structure of an endemic atyid shrimp, Halocaridina rubra, in these habitats. The native alpheid shrimp, Metabetaeus lohena, whose known range entirely overlaps that of H. rubra, has feeding and reproductive behaviors that are biologically distinct from H. rubra. Its historic scarcity and status as a candidate for the US Fish and Wildlife Department's Endangered Species List, make M. lohena an ideal species to compare against the known genetic structure of H. rubra. We investigated the population structure of this native anchialine shrimp to test the hypothesis that genetic popula- tion structure differs between the two shrimp species and that M. lohena is genetically unstructured across its range. A survey of 605 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from 127 individuals collected at 7 sites spanning the islands of O'ahu, Maui and Hawaii revealed 43 haplotypes. The most common haplotype was represented in similar proportions from all sites sampled, accounting for 44% of the surveyed sequences. Analyses of molecular variation (AMOv A), pairwise F ST values, Bayesian estimates of migration (M), Mantel tests and Nested Clade Analyses (NCAs) all failed to reveal evidence of major barriers to gene flow among most populations separated by inter-island channels. This lack of genetic structure in M. lohena is found to be in stark contrast with the highly structured population of H. rubra, and may be attributed to oceanic dispersal strategies and/or a recent introduction to the Hawaiian Islands.

Hauri},doi={10.4319/lo.1981.26.3.0414},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={1975615538},journal={Limnology and Oceanography},abstract={Perennial swarms of sexually immature medusae of the germs Mastigias occur at high densities in three marine lakes in Palau, Western Caroline Islands. Numbers per lake are 1.76 ± 0.10 × 105, 1.61 ± 0.17 × 106, and 4.69 ± 0.51 × 106. Local density within a swarm may exceed 1,000·m‒2. Behaviorally generated swarms form in the early morning and late afternoon and are temporarily dispersed by directional horizontal migration of the entire swarm twice a day to opposite ends of the lake. Distance swum each day is up to 1 km, depending on the size of the lake. Compass direction of migration is different in each lake and appears to depend on both light and basin morphometry.}}

Steinitz Memorial Lecture of April 1973 at the Steinitz Marine Biology Laboratory in Elat. It was first published in October of the same year (Holthuis 1973). “Anchialos” meaning in Greek “near the sea”, the new term stands for “pools with no surface connection, containing salt or brackish water, which fluctuates with the tide”.}}
